# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Repository
The Tic Tac Toe GitHub repository is a project that implements the classic two-player game of Tic Tac Toe using React. It serves as a simple and fun example of a game development project  to learn and practice programming concepts.

1.Game Logic: The repository contains the core logic and algorithms that govern the game's rules, such as checking for wins, detecting draws, and handling player moves.

2.User Interface (UI): The project may include a graphical user interface to facilitate user interaction with the game. It has been implemented React and CSS.

3.Multiplayer Support: The repository might offer the option to play against another human player, taking turns to make moves on the board.

4.Documentation: Well-documented code and a README file explain how to set up the project, how to play the game, and any additional information relevant to the repository.
